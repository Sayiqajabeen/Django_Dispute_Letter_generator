#     Dear [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department,  
#     I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and/or unverifiable bankruptcy information listed on my credit report. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Metro-2 Reporting Standards, I am requesting an immediate investigation to ensure that only accurate, complete, and verifiable information is reported.
#     Specific Errors
#     1. Case Information:  
#        - Error(s): Incorrect court name, case number mismatch, improper status as open, incorrect filing or discharge date.  
#        - Supporting Evidence: Court documents showing case resolution or absence of filing.  
#     2. Public Record Reporting:  
#        - Error(s): Record not verified with the appropriate court, incorrect inclusion in report after removal.  
#        - Supporting Evidence: Statement or response from the court or other public record sources.  

#     Requested Action

#      1. Verify with the appropriate court that the reported bankruptcy information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.  
#      2. Remove the bankruptcy information if it cannot be verified as accurate and complete.  
#      3. Notify me in writing once the investigation is complete and confirm the actions taken regarding the disputed information.  

#      Legal Basis for Dispute
#      Under FCRA Section 611 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681i), credit reporting agencies are required to investigate disputes and verify the accuracy of the reported information. Additionally:
#        - FCRA Section 609 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681g) provides me with the right to request how this bankruptcy was verified.  
#        - Metro-2 Reporting Standards dictate accurate and timely reporting of bankruptcy status and details.  
#        - Inaccurate or unverifiable public record information violates FCRA Section 623 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681s-2).  

#     Supporting Documents
#     I have enclosed the following documents to assist in your investigation:
#      1. Copy of my government-issued ID.  
#      2. Copy of my credit report with the disputed bankruptcy information highlighted.  
#      3. Court records and/or other supporting evidence showing inaccuracies in the reporting.  

#      Additional Notes
#      This information must be verified directly with the court and not with third-party vendors. If this information cannot be verified as accurate and complete, it must be removed under FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(A).  
#      I expect a resolution to this matter within the 30-day period as required by law.

#       [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department  
#       [Address of Credit Bureau]  

#       Subject: Dispute of Inaccurate Bankruptcy Reporting  
#       Dear [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department,  
#       I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and/or unverifiable bankruptcy information listed on my credit report. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Metro-2 Reporting Standards, I am requesting an immediate investigation to ensure that only accurate, complete, and verifiable information is reported.
    
#       Inaccurate Bankruptcy Information:
                        
#       | Court Name or Creditor | Case/Account Number | Filing/Reporting Date | Reason for Dispute |
#       |------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
#       | {court_name} | {case_number} | {filing_date} | {incorrect_filing_date} |

#       Specific Errors:
#           1. Case Information:  
#             - Error(s): Incorrect court name, case number mismatch, improper status as open, incorrect filing or discharge date.  
#             - Supporting Evidence: Court documents showing case resolution or absence of filing.  
#           2. Public Record Reporting:  
#            - Error(s): Record not verified with the appropriate court, incorrect inclusion in report after removal.  
#            - Supporting Evidence: Statement or response from the court or other public record sources.                    

#       Requested Action:

#       1. Verify with the appropriate court that the reported bankruptcy information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.  
#       2. Remove the bankruptcy information if it cannot be verified as accurate and complete.  
#       3. Notify me in writing once the investigation is complete and confirm the actions taken regarding the disputed information.  

#       Legal Basis for Dispute:
#       Under FCRA Section 611 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681i), credit reporting agencies are required to investigate disputes and verify the accuracy of the reported information. Additionally:
#         - FCRA Section 609 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681g) provides me with the right to request how this bankruptcy was verified.  
#         - Metro-2 Reporting Standards dictate accurate and timely reporting of bankruptcy status and details.  
#         - Inaccurate or unverifiable public record information violates FCRA Section 623 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681s-2).  

#       Supporting Documents:
#       I have enclosed the following documents to assist in your investigation:
#       1. Copy of my government-issued ID.  
#       2. Copy of my credit report with the disputed bankruptcy information highlighted.  
#       3. Court records and/or other supporting evidence showing inaccuracies in the reporting.  

#       Additional Notes:
#       This information must be verified directly with the court and not with third-party vendors. If this information cannot be verified as accurate and complete, it must be removed under FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(A).  
#       I expect a resolution to this matter within the 30-day period as required by law.  
#       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.  

#       Sincerely,  
#       [Your Full Name]  

#       Enclosures:
#       1. Copy of Government-issued ID  
#       2. Highlighted Credit Report  
#       3. Court Records/Supporting Documentation  

#       Extract and populate the details from 'base_knowleged' where appropriate.
